            1st time there and the experience was great. Our server, Tommy, was
            great and really helpful. I had the romaine salad with bacon and
            tomatoes and the filet mignon. Both were awesome. My wife had gumbo
            and a seafood special that she loved. Drinks were delicious as well.
            We shared a bread pudding dessert that was one of the best in town.
            Can't wait to go back. Food: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Atmosphere: 5/5
